## Obtaining an api key
- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Create a new project or select an existing project.
- Navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard".
- Click "Enable APIs and Services".
- Search for "YouTube Data API v3" and enable it.
- Go to "Credentials" and click "Create Credentials".
- Select "API Key" and copy the generated key. This is your apiKey.


  ## Finding YouTube Channel IDs
  - Go to the YouTube channel you want to add.
  - Click on the channel name to go to their main page.
  - Look at the URL of the channel. It will be in one of the following formats:
  - - `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw`
    - `https://www.youtube.com/user/username`
  - If the URL is in the format /channel/, the string after /channel/ is the Channel ID.
  - If the URL is in the format /user/, you need to use the YouTube Data API to find the Channel ID from the username.
 

    ## Usage
     - Start your MagicMirrorÂ².
     - The module will fetch and display the latest news titles from the specified YouTube channels.
     - Titles containing specified keywords (e.g., "live") will be excluded from display.
   

    ## Troubleshooting
    - Ensure you have a valid YouTube API key and have not exceeded your quota.
    - Check the console logs for any error messages if the module is not working as expected.
    - Enable debug mode in the configuration to see more detailed logs.
